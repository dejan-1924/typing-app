## Typing test 

A simple typing app which allows users to test their typing skills. User can choose between two different difficulties, one of them generates most used English words and the other one generates less used and more complicated words. There are also two different modes, first one lets user choose a time limit and the second one lets user choose desired number of words. When the typing test is done, user can see the statistics including number of typed words, time elapsed and number of words per minute. Built using React and CSS.
Login and registration pages are added, but functionalities are not.
In the future, registered users will be able to log in and save their results, so they can compete with other users.
